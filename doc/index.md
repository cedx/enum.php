## Yet another implementation of enumerated types
This implementation, based on [traits](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php), gives a set of static methods to ease working with the `public` constants of a class representing an enumerated type.

Unlike other [PHP](https://www.php.net) implementations, like the [SplEnum](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.splenum.php) class, it does not rely on object instances.

## Quick start
Install the latest version of **Enums for PHP** with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

``` shell
composer require cedx/enum
```

For detailed instructions, see the [installation guide](installation.md).
